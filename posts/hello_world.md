Haii, this is my new website, and with it, my new blog 🥳 <br/> <br/>
I don't think I'll make a lot of posts here 😭, but soon you'll find one on how this website was made!

Other than that, if you're someone who lost contact with me since the online persona switch, you can very well try contacting me via the various social media links on the sidebar.

Love y'all!
