## new year, same me

i’m not a big fan of new year’s resolutions, as i find them difficult to
stick to. instead, i prefer to set specific, achievable goals for
myself. this year, i have a few things i want to accomplish.

## learn a new language

i’ve always wanted to learn japanese, but i’ve struggled to find ways to
practice & improve my skills.

this year, i hope to find the motivation to stick with it & make
progress, especially since i also have a friend who is learning
japanese, so we can practice together.

## learn a new programming language

as much as i love javascript & typescript, i’m ready to branch out &
learn a new programming language. i’m considering rust, zig, & ocaml,
but i haven’t yet decided which one i want to focus on. my main goal is
to be able to write a little interpreter by the end of the year,
something i’ve attempted before but never quite managed to complete.

i’m not sure if i’ll be able to accomplish any of these goals, but i’m
going to try my best. i hope you have a great year & are able to achieve
your own goals too.
